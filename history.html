							A widely repeated story connects the toppings tomato (red), mozzarella (white), and basil

							often described as a popular attribution rather than a fully proven origin for pizza itself.

					<h4>Queen Margherita of Savoy</h4>
					<p class="figure-role">Italian queen associated with the Margherita pizza story</p>
					<p>
						The classic tomato-mozzarella-basil combination is popularly linked to Queen Margherita and
						the Italian flag colors. On many timelines, this story represents pizza's shift from street food
						into a symbol of national pride, even though pizza existed before the Margherita legend.

					<h4>Raffaele Esposito</h4>
					<p class="figure-role">Neapolitan pizzaiolo often credited in the 1889 Margherita story</p>
					<p>
						The creation of Pizza Margherita is often attributed to Raffaele Esposito in 1889, where he is
						said to have prepared pizzas in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy. This is a famous and meaningful
						origin story, but it's best described as an “often attributed” tradition rather than the beginning
						of pizza history.

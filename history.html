						<h4>Naples becomes the home of modern pizza</h4>
						<p>
							Over time, Naples developed a strong pizza tradition and a culture of pizza makers, 
							known as “pizzaioli”, helped shape what many people think of as classic pizza today.

						<h4>1889 — The “Margherita” story becomes famous</h4>
						<p>
							A widely repeated story connects the toppings tomato (red), mozzarella (white), and basil
							(green) to Queen Margherita of Savoy and the colors of the Italian flag. This connection is
							often described as a popular attribution rather than a fully proven origin for pizza itself.

					<h4>Queen Margherita of Savoy</h4>
					<p class="figure-role">Italian queen associated with the Margherita pizza story</p>
					<p>
						The classic tomato-mozzarella-basil combination is popularly linked to Queen Margherita and
						the Italian flag colors. On many timelines, this story represents pizza's shift from street food
						into a symbol of national pride, even though pizza existed before the Margherita legend.

										<h4>Raffaele Esposito</h4>
					<p class="figure-role">Neapolitan pizzaiolo often credited in the 1889 Margherita story</p>
					<p>
						The creation of Pizza Margherita is often attributed to Raffaele Esposito in 1889, where he is
						said to have prepared pizzas in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy. This is a famous and meaningful
						origin story, but it's best described as an “often attributed” tradition rather than the beginning
						of pizza history.
